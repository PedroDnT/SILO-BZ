**Done.** Three presentation fixes in the diagnosis report, `src/portfolio/report/` only.

1. Body table "Retorno passado contra o CDI": a "% do CDI" column of its own, read from
   `returns.lines[i].windows[j].pct_of_cdi`. Where the engine did not compute it, the column shows the fixed text of
   `pct_of_cdi_reason_code` (`common.REASON_TEXT`), also for a share or an FII. The difference stays in p.p.
2. Fee headline and page-1 "Custo": the disclosed fixed fee and the disclosed range side by side, same weight, each
   with its coverage of the fund value (`fees.summary.coverage_fixed_fund_value_pct`,
   `coverage_range_fund_value_pct`). The fake Redator's page-1 cost finding and the prompt's `resumo` item say the same.
3. Page 1 "Pontos a conferir": restatements grouped per fund (one point, each competência with its field count);
   a missing `n_fields_changed` reads "número de campos não disponível"; the FGC caveat once per Redator finding.

**Decisions.**
- No total of fixed fee plus range: `engine-output.md` says `fees.summary` carries none, so none is shown.
- 3a's example says "n/d" and 3b says "número de campos não disponível"; the explicit 3b wording is used.
- Restatements are grouped by statement line (`line_id`), not by fund name, which the view can lack.
- FGC repetition cause: the prompt asked for "a conferir" *with* `concentration.fgc.label` (which already starts with
  "a conferir"), and the risk row adds `explanation` and `check_label`, both with the same caveat. Fixed in the
  Redator prompt and in the fake writer's title. `risks.py` (engine) was not changed.

**Assumptions.** The prompt change was checked only with `--provider fake`; no live model call was made.

**Outside scope.** None in code. Local machine: `pango` was installed with Homebrew so WeasyPrint could build the PDF.
Seen, not fixed: the risk table's FGC row prints the caveat twice (its `check_label` and its `explanation`), which
needs an engine text change in `risks.py`.
